## Description


The project was implemented from scratch (so far, this is how I assess my knowledge). It contains information about the Geely vehicle system. This project shows the relationship between the manufacturer (seller) of cars and the buyer (dealer). It is based on the Geely car brand. At a minimum, this project will describe all possible models of the Geely car and their modifications, which will allow you to get to know this brand better. You can also use the "skeleton" of the project for your own purposes, because in fact this project is a store. And of course - uniqueness, I doubt that this organization has guessed to create a similar project for its own needs (which is extremely strange, for such a huge concern, but ... God be their judge)

**This project is inspired by [EdiBoba](https://github.com/EdiBoba)** .
