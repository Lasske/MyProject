## Description


The project was implemented from scratch (so far, this is how I assess my knowledge). It contains information about the Geely vehicle system and the supply of vehicles from the manufacturer to dealerships. I created this project as part of the "Python programming" course from the Belhard school. So don't expect too much from this project, don't pay attention to possible errors in the code, because I'm just learning xDDD.

**This project is inspired by [EdiBoba](https://github.com/EdiBoba)** .


## About the project.

This project shows the relationship between the manufacturer (seller) of cars and the buyer (dealer). It is based on the Geely car brand.

## Key features

At a minimum, this project will describe all possible models of the Geely car and their modifications, which will allow you to get to know this brand better. You can also use the "skeleton" of the project for your own purposes, because in fact this project is a store. And of course - uniqueness, I doubt that this organization has guessed to create a similar project for its own needs (which is extremely strange, for such a huge concern, but ... God be their judge)

## Project setup

```
MySQL
Python 3x
SQLAlchemy
Rest api framework
FastAPI framework
```

## Future scope

- Write migrations to the project
- Cover the project with tests.
- Add Docker
- Add and describe files: Dockerfile and .dockerignore
- Make authentication / authorization and separation of user rights (user and administrator)
